  "body": "## materials.sh\r\n\r\nmaterials.sh is an initiative to build the world's most comprehensive collection\r\nof useful software for materials science. \r\n\r\nThe intent is to improve the accessibility of these tools to all researchers by\r\nenabling one-line installations of highly useful software packages without the need \r\nfor compilation, etc. All packages are hosted on the `matsci` channel on Anaconda\r\nCloud.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Preparing your system\r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n1. Download Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (the free Community Edition) is fine.\r\n2. Install Visual Studio 2015, but *make sure that you select More Options ->\r\n   Programming Languages -> Visual C++ during the installation process*. By\r\n   default, Visual Studio does not install Visual C++, which is needed.\r\n\r\n#### Mac OSX\r\n\r\n1. Download and install Xcode. Afterwards, install the XCode command line\r\n   tools by typing the following in a terminal::\r\n\r\n        xcode-select --install\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n1. Usually no preparation is needed as most of the standard compilers should\r\n   already be available.\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Install conda\r\n\r\nDownload and install the version of conda for your operating system from\r\nhttp://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html. For Windows, **make sure it is the\r\nMiniconda3 installer**, and simply double-click the exe file. For Linux or Mac,\r\nrun::\r\n\r\n    # If Mac\r\n    bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh\r\n\r\n    # If Linux\r\n    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\r\n\r\nNote that you may need to create a new terminal after this step in order for\r\nthe environmental variables added by conda to be loaded.\r\n\r\n### Step 2b: (Optional) Create a conda environment\r\n\r\nIf you are working with many python packages, it is generally recommended you\r\ncreate a separate environment for each of your packages. For example::\r\n\r\n    conda create --name my_env python\r\n    source activate my_env  # OSX or Linux\r\n    activate my_env  # Windows\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Add the matsci channel\r\n\r\nYou can now install materials science software packages in materials.sh via the \r\nfollowing command::\r\n\r\n    conda install --channel matsci <package>\r\n\r\nwhere `--channel matsci` indicates to use the matsci channel.\r\n\r\nIf you believe you will be using the channel frequently, you can add it to the list\r\nof channels in your environment with the following command::\r\n\r\n    conda config --add channels matsci\r\n\r\n## Available packages\r\n\r\nThe packages available are constantly updated. You can check out the currently \r\navailable packages on the `matsci channel on Anaconda Cloud <https://anaconda.org/matsci>`_, or simply look at the conda-skeletons folder in this repo. This initiative \r\narose from the desire to make `Python Materials Genomics <http://pymatgen.org>`_ and \r\nits associated dependencies a lot easier to install for users on all platforms, so these\r\nwill always be available.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nContributions are always welcome. Feel free to fork this repo and add your proposed\r\nconda software recipes to the conda-skeletons folder. This repo is continuously\r\nintegrated via TravisCI and Appveyor to build all Linux, OSX and Windows versions, \r\nwhere compatible.\r\n",
