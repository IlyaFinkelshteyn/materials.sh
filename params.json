  "body": "materials.sh is an initiative to build the world's most comprehensive collection of software for materials science.\r\n\r\nThe intent is to improve the accessibility of these tools to all researchers by enabling one-line installations of highly useful software packages without the need for compilation, etc. All packages are hosted on the `matsci` channel on Anaconda Cloud.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nThe instructions are written for Python 3. For Windows, this is the only supported platform. For other OSes, the instructions below can be trivially modified for Python 2.7.\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Preparing your system\r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n1. Download Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (the free Community Edition) is fine.\r\n2. Install Visual Studio 2015, but *make sure that you select More Options -> Programming Languages -> Visual C++ during the installation process*. By default, Visual Studio does not install Visual C++, which is needed.\r\n\r\n#### Mac OSX\r\n\r\n1. Download and install Xcode. Afterwards, install the XCode command line tools by typing the following in a terminal:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nxcode-select --install\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n1. Usually no preparation is needed as most of the standard compilers should already be available.\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Install conda\r\n\r\nDownload and install the version of conda for your operating system from http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, **make sure it is the Miniconda3 installer**, and simply double-click the exe file.\r\n\r\nFor Mac, run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -o Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh\r\nbash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Linux, run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nwget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh;\r\nbash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that you may need to create a new terminal after this step in order for the environmental variables added by conda to be loaded.\r\n\r\n### Step 2b: (Optional) Create a conda environment\r\n\r\nIf you are working with many python packages, it is generally recommended you create a separate environment for each of your packages. For example:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nconda create --name my_env python\r\nsource activate my_env  # OSX or Linux\r\nactivate my_env  # Windows\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Add the matsci channel\r\n\r\nYou can now install materials science software packages in materials.sh via the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nconda install --channel matsci <package>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `--channel matsci` indicates to use the matsci channel.\r\n\r\nIf you believe you will be using the channel frequently, you can add it to the list of channels in your environment with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nconda config --add channels matsci\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Available packages\r\n\r\nThe packages available are constantly updated. You can check out the currently available packages on the [matsci channel on Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/matsci), or simply look at the conda-skeletons folder in this repo. As of writing, the packages available are:\r\n\r\n* bader\r\n* custodian\r\n* enumlib\r\n* latexcodec\r\n* monty\r\n* palettable\r\n* pybtex\r\n* pydispatcher\r\n* pymatgen\r\n* pymatgen-diffusion\r\n* seekpath\r\n* spglib\r\n* tabulate\r\n\r\nThis effort initially arose from the desire to make [Python Materials Genomics](http://www.pymatgen.org) and its associated dependencies a lot easier to install for users on all platforms. So these will always be available. Please note that not all packages are available for all OSes.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nContributions are always welcome. Feel free to fork this repo and add your proposed conda software recipes to the conda-skeletons folder. This repo is continuously integrated via TravisCI and Appveyor to build all Linux, OSX and Windows versions, where compatible.\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\nThis initiative is started by the [Materials Virtual Lab](http://materialsvirtuallab.org).",
